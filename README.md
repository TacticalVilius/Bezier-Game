Bezier-Game
===========

A physics engine for a car racing game, where the track follows a user generated Bezier curve. The game uses OpenGL v3.3.

DONE:
- Framework for drawing objects with OpenGL.
- Creation of Bezier curves.
- Generation of a track that follows a given Bezier curve.
- Collision detection.
- Elastic collisions (still treats all objects as if they are homogenous spheres).

CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
- Rotation of objects based on location of collision on the object.

COMING UP:
- Inelastic collisions.
